## Modal Glossary entries

I have glossary entries defined in markdown files located in `/src/content/docs/glossary` [on github](https://github.com/userdocs/starlight-glossary/tree/main/src/content/docs/glossary)

They are called using the `/src/components/modal.astro` component. [on github](https://github.com/userdocs/starlight-glossary/blob/main/src/components/modal.astro)

Like this, to create an interactive glossary modal when clicked on:

```mdx
import Modal from "/src/components/modal.astro"

1 <Modal id="bash" label="bash"/> 2 <Modal id="buildjet" label="buildjet"/> 3 <Modal id="crossbuild-essentials" label="crossbuild-essentials"/> 4 <Modal id="docker" label="docker"/> 5 <Modal id="docker-desktop" label="docker-desktop"/>
6 <Modal id="github" label="github"/> 7 <Modal id="github-actions" label="github-actions"/> 8 <Modal id="github-releases" label="github-releases"/> 9 <Modal id="github-workflows" label="github-workflows"/> 10 <Modal id="glibc" label="glibc"/>
<Modal id="musl-cross-make" label="musl-cross-make"/>
<Modal id="muslc" label="muslc"/>
<Modal id="powershell" label="powershell"/>
<Modal id="qemu" label="qemu"/>
<Modal id="wsl2" label="wsl2"/>
```

## The interaction

The glossary files are formatted like this

```md
---
title: title
hide_title: true
---

ðŸŸ¦ Section 1

--- // how the file is split into sections

Section 2
```

Example: <Modal id="test" label="Test glossary entry"/>

<Image
  src={Test}
  alt=""
/>

## Glossary page and automatic links

There is also a dynamically generated glossary page populated by `/src/components/glossary.astro`  [on github](https://github.com/userdocs/starlight-glossary/blob/main/src/pages/glossary.astro)

[glossary](/starlight-glossary/glossary)


## The problem

I had to use javascript to create the dialog and prepend it to the body. This allowed me to inline them. Nothing else i tried worked as something about the `<dialog></dialog>` and maybe mdx adds unwanted `<p>` elements.

I think the idea of a glossary was good and it started with this docusaurus plugin: https://github.com/grnet/docusaurus-terminology

But it always felt over complicated for the task it wanted to achieve. I think this astro version is much simpler and easier to maintain.

So this a combined effort of copilot, Kapa and I to create what seems like a functional proof of concept that does not offend page speed.

I though it easier to explain here that discord but i'm looking for feedback on this approach and if it's a good idea to continue with it.
